**Title:** `AUTH_ERROR_TYPES` (Enumeration)

**Purpose:** Lists authentication-related error types that may accompany a `NOT_ALLOWED_ERROR` when creating or joining a conference. Use these values to present appropriate UI messaging or trigger specific auth flows.

**Members (CSV)**
```csv
stt,enum,value,description
1,GENERAL,"general","General authentication error"
2,NO_MAIN_PARTICIPANTS,"no-main-participants","No main participants available"
3,NO_VISITORS_LOBBY,"no-visitors-lobby","Conference has a visitors-only lobby"
4,PROMOTION_NOT_ALLOWED,"promotion-not-allowed","Promotion to participant is not allowed"
5,ROOM_CREATION_RESTRICTION,"room-creation-restriction","Room creation is restricted"
6,ROOM_UNAUTHENTICATED_ACCESS_DISABLED,"authentication-required","Unauthenticated access is disabled"
```

**Notes:** Detailed descriptions for each enum variant are not included in the upstream source—keep enum names and values stable to match runtime behavior in the library.
