**Class ReceiveVideoController** Manages receive-video constraints for a `JitsiConference`. The application determines these constraints based on how remote video streams should be displayed. This class communicates the selected constraints to the bridge over the bridge channel.

The following lists constructors, properties and methods in CSV form:

```csv
Stt,Name,Type,Parameters and description,Description
1,constructor,Constructor,"conference: JitsiConference (the conference instance this controller will manage)",Create a new `ReceiveVideoController` instance for a given conference [1].
2,_getDefaultSourceReceiverConstraints,Method,"mediaSession: JingleSessionPC (media session), maxFrameHeight?: number (requested max frame height for remote sources)",Returns a map of all remote source names to their corresponding maximum frame heights [2].
3,_updateIndividualConstraints,Method,"maxFrameHeight?: number (requested max frame height for remote sources)",Update per-source constraints based on the configured max height [3].
4,getCurrentReceiverConstraints,Method,N/A,"Returns the set of receiver constraints currently set on the bridge channel (IReceiverVideoConstraints)" [3, 4].
5,getLastN,Method,N/A,Returns the current lastN value for the conference [4].
6,isLastNLimitedByCpu,Method,N/A,Check whether last-N is being lowered due to CPU limitations [4].
7,onMediaSessionStarted,Method,"mediaSession: JingleSessionPC (media session started)",Handle `JitsiConferenceEvents.MEDIA_SESSION_STARTED`, applying preferred receive max-frame-height to the media session [4, 5].
8,setAssumedBandwidthBps,Method,"assumedBandwidthBps?: number (new value)",Set the assumed bandwidth (bps) that the local participant should expect from remote participants [5].
9,setLastN,Method,"value: number (new lastN value, -1 for no limit)",Select a new `lastN` value. The requested number of videos will be sent once the value takes effect [5, 6].
10,setLastNLimitedByCpu,Method,"enabled: boolean",Update the `lastNLimitedByCpu` flag [6].
11,setPreferredReceiveMaxFrameHeight,Method,"maxFrameHeight?: number (new value)",Set the preferred maximum receive-frame-height for the local participant [7].
12,setReceiverConstraints,Method,"constraints: IReceiverVideoConstraints (video constraints)",Set the receiver constraints for the conference [7].
13,setReceiveResolutionLimitedByCpu,Method,"enabled: boolean",Update the `receiveResolutionLimitedByCpu` flag [8].
